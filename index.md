# David "Dave" Vigil (he/him)

I love the world of code, deployment, testing, and I hate blinking lights (aka physical hardware). I came up as a Linux Admin that found every opportunity I could to codify everything my team and I were doing. I am passionate about easily deployable, elegant, easy-to-read code.

*Senior Solutions Architect*

- Lead Architect for expanding configuration management (Ansible) throughout the Labs. Built CI pipelines for all Ansible code to allow other departments to contribute to code. The CI pipeline used GitLab runners which were in multiple Rancher-built Kubenetes clusters that I built. Wrote a custom Molecule driver which used Terraform to build VMs in on-prem Azure Stack and on-prem OpenStack clusters to run tests. Worked with CyberSecurity and Common Operating Environment teams to establish a code base. Built a Python Flask application to allow automated adding of Linux hosts running node_exporter to Prometheus/Grafana monitoring via GitLab and Helm. Wrote Terraform templates to help multiple teams push for Infrastructure As Code.  

**Rackspace** / June 2018 - Sept 2019

*Senior DevOps Engineer*

- Leading a DevOps team that successfully migrated a monolithic Java code base deployed via Chef to a collection of microservices.  This environment tests on Google Cloud Build then, using Spinnaker, deploys on multiple clusters on Google Kubernetes Engine. This fully automated CI/CD pipeline is initiated from a develop commit and ends in full  deployments on Dev and Stage clusters with zero  human intervention.  I manage the development of  Helm charts that maintain the infrastructure-as-code deployments for  microservices to Kubernetes.  I also develop and manage processes for day two maintenance of the current infrastructure consisting of over 500 Ubuntu servers across five data centers distributed around the world.
